I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the\
newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether sea-going\
people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and\
preferred cork jackets, I don\'92t know; all I know is, that there was but\
one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the\
bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance\
in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher\
bargain. Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead\
loss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother\'92s own sherry was in the\
market then--and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle\
down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a\
head, the winner to spend five shillings. I was present myself, and I\
remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of\
myself being disposed of in that way. The caul was won, I recollect, by\
an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it\
the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny\
short--as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to\
endeavour without any effect to prove to her. It is a fact which will\
be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,\
but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it\
was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the\
water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which\
she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation\
at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go\
\'91meandering\'92 about the world. It was in vain to represent to her\
that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this\
objectionable practice. She always returned, with greater emphasis and\
with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, \'91Let us\
have no meandering.\'92}
